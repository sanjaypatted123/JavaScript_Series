ASYNCHRONOUS AND  CALLBACK in JS:


asynchronous example in js:
console.log("I");

// This will be shown after 2 seconds

setTimeout(()=>{
  console.log("eat");
},2000)

console.log("Ice Cream")


//------------------//
callbacks:

When you nest a function inside another function as an argument, that's called a callback.

go to image to know the execution

Why do we use callbacks?
When doing a complex task, we break that task down into smaller steps. 
To help us establish a relationship between these steps according to time (optional) 
and order, we use callbacks.
